<p>Since <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.linkedin.com&#47;in&#47;campgroundautomation">Tyler<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.linkedin.com&#47;pub&#47;jon-sharp&#47;0&#47;2a1&#47;a4b">I<&#47;a> began our startup venture, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.campgroundautomation.com">Campground Automation Systems<&#47;a>, 5 years ago, I may have neglected this blog, but I've managed to stay active in my retrocomputing&#47;collecting efforts.  I'm always on the lookout for unique, rare or otherwise interesting vintage computer items on Craigslist and eBay and I've managed to find some real gems over the past several years.  As I strive to keep this site more current, I plan to feature some of these items in greater depth over the next several months.</p>
<p>Recent acquisitions to my collection include: a Commodore 8032-SK, Apple IIc, IIe, Macintosh Portable, Mac 128K, Apple 1 Replica (Replica 1), TRS-80 Model 100, and a Canon Cat.  The Macintosh Portable required some restoration, and I've performed various upgrades on each of these.  I attempt to use them all, if only for a few minutes at a time.  I don't want to see them all simply collecting dust.  I'm proud of each of them, though if I were honest, I'd have to say I'm most proud of the Cat.  It's such a unique computer, quite unlike anything I'd used previously.  In my next Retrocomputing post, I plan to showcase the Cat and the modifications I've made with the help of some of the members of the Canon Cat group. (Thanks Dwight!)</p>
