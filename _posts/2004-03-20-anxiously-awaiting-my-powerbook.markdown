<p>I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my new 17" PowerBook.  It is scheduled to be delivered sometime today.  I have requested that it be delivered after I return from church, but I'm afraid I may be rather distracted during the sermon today.  I ordered a 17" PowerBook with 1.33Ghz G4 from the Apple Store earlier this week.  I expect the case to arrive in the next few days.  Anyway, I'm very excited about it and will post pictures soon.</p>
