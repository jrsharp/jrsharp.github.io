<p>I found it interesting that Slashdot ran a Chernobyl headline just a week or two after I ran across <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.angelfire.com&#47;extreme4&#47;kiddofspeed&#47;">this site<&#47;a> that I commented on in my earlier blog entry.  I was fascinated at the time with the story of Chernobyl, (which I knew very little about previously) and thought it would be interesting to see it someday.  Then Slashdot runs <a href="http:&#47;&#47;science.slashdot.org&#47;article.pl?sid=04&#47;04&#47;27&#47;1850255&mode=thread&tid=134&tid=186">this story<&#47;a> about tourism to Chernobyl.  Anyway, I just thought it worth comment.</p>
