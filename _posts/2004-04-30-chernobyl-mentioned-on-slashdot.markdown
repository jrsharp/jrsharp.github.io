I found it interesting that Slashdot ran a Chernobyl headline just a week or two after I ran across the site that I commented on in my earlier blog entry.  <!--more-->  I was fascinated at the time with the story of Chernobyl, (which I knew very little about previously) and thought it would be interesting to see it someday.  Then Slashdot runs [this story](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/27/1850255&mode=thread&tid=134&tid=186) about tourism to Chernobyl.  Anyway, I just thought it worth comment.
