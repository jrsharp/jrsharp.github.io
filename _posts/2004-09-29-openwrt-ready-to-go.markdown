<p>I have been keeping a close eye on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;openwrt.org">OpenWrt project<&#47;a> ever since I purchased my Linksys Wrt54G 802.11g Wireless AP&#47;Router.  I have wanted to use the OpenWrt firmware to give my router IPv6 routing capabilities and provide finer-grained firewall&#47;VPN control.  I have been waiting for a while for the IPv6 modules and documentation to become available, and they have.  </p>
<p>I checked everything out from CVS last week and built the firmware on my Linux box.  (It does a complete cross-compile build for the MIPS architecture.)  I now have the firmware image and kernel modules sitting on my Linux box waiting to be installed on my Wrt54G.  I have hesitated to perform such an operation for obvious reasons.  I am currently taking classes online, and I cannot be without my connection.  Anyway, after I get a chance to go over and over the documentation, I'll try to get my new router set up proper.</p>
