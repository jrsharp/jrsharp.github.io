I have been keeping a close eye on the [OpenWrt project](http://openwrt.org">OpenWrt project) ever since I purchased my Linksys Wrt54G 802.11g Wireless AP/Router.  I have wanted to use the OpenWrt firmware to give my router IPv6 routing capabilities and provide finer-grained firewall/VPN control.  I have been waiting for a while for the IPv6 modules and documentation to become available, and they have.

I checked everything out from CVS last week and built the firmware on my Linux box.  (It does a complete cross-compile build for the MIPS architecture.)  I now have the firmware image and kernel modules sitting on my Linux box waiting to be installed on my Wrt54G.  I have hesitated to perform such an operation for obvious reasons.  I am currently taking classes online, and I cannot be without my connection.  Anyway, after I get a chance to go over and over the documentation, I'll try to get my new router set up proper.
