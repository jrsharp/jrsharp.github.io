I just added a new "Trail Log" feature to replace my old, very simple one.  Since moving my entire site's content into the WordPress engine using static pages, I needed a new solution for a trail log.  In this case, I decided to use the WordPress blog engine itself to record my trail log entries.  I established new template files to handle the displaying of this new blog category.  The result is a very functional, attractive list of trails I have hiked.  It will be much easier to keep up to date and I look forward to filling it up with info.  You can click the "Trail Log" link on the right, or <a href="http://jonsharp.net/archives/category/personal/outdoors/trail-log/">click here</a>.
