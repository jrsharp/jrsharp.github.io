<p>After recently deciding to strike out on my own professionally, I've had to do some test-driving of some software that's designed to make running a small business easier.  I tested the following software:</p>
<ul>
<li>iBiz<&#47;li>
<li>TaskTime<&#47;li>
<li>Daylite<&#47;li>
<li>Studiometry<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Each piece of software has its own qualities, of course, and they are not exactly equivalent in their feature sets.  I was primarily interested in CRM functionality, time management, and invoice generation.  After taking a reasonable look at each, I ended up purchasing Studiometry.  Studiometry was more expensive than some of the other options, but certainly provided more functionality.  It has really made tracking multiple clients and projects very easy while providing a very flexible invoicing &#47; reporting mechanism.  I'm really digging it, so far.</p>
