<p>I happened to be looking over the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.awstats.org">awstats<&#47;a> results for my site recently and noticed a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wikipedia.org">Wikipedia<&#47;a> article that links to an article of mine <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jonsharp.net&#47;archives&#47;2005&#47;05&#47;06&#47;installing-tiger-on-lombard&#47;">describing how to install Mac OS X Tiger on unsupported models<&#47;a>.  </p>
<p>The Wikipedia article that links to me is one about the Apple <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Ibook">iBook<&#47;a>.  The article describes the method I came up with for installing Tiger on my unsupported PowerBook G3 (Lombard).  It summarizes the steps involved in a clearer manner than my article does.  It also links to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.hardmac.com&#47;archives&#47;tiger-on-clamshell-ibook">another blog article<&#47;a> which references my article while applying it to Tiger installation on a clamshell iBook.</p>
<p>I think it's great to have a Wikipedia article referencing my work.  It is generating a fair bit of traffic and I appreciate the association with other fine sites.</p>
