<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I just wanted to take the opportunity to highlight the startup effort of several friends of mine.  Their company &#47; service is called WeatheRate, and in their words:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We specialize in the rating of overhead transmission and distribution lines for the electricity distribution sector. Our services enable our clients to defer capital and increase operational flexibility using existing network infrastructure.<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Please, head over to their <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;pages&#47;WeatheRate&#47;205493752885372">Facebook page<&#47;a> and give them a "Like."  And if you have a need for weather-related monitoring of overhead transmission and distribution lines, sign on up! ;)</p>
