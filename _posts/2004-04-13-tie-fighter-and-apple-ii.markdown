  content: I'm sure you do.  Karateka was great.  I played it the other day on KEGS
    for OS X.  It was almost like a precursor to the Street Fighter genre.  Anywho,
    hopefully it will be part of my video game box soon.

<p>Jolene and I recently visited my family and I discovered my old set of Tie Fighter disks at their home.  I became nostalgic as I am prone to do at times and decided to take the disks home and see if the floppies still worked.  The first floppy appears to work just fine, but it does not want to install on my Windows 2000 computer.  This obstacle gave rise to a great idea -- incorporate this old classic into my home entertainment PC!  I began researching DosEmu, and DosBox to determine whether either would run Tie Fighter.  It looks like maybe Tie Fighter has problems with these two DOS emulators for Linux, but I plan on trying, anyway.  It will take some work, but as I get the time, I plan on trying to add a "DOS Games" section to my Freevo menu.</p>
<p>Apple II nostalgia has also struck me recently.  The Apple IIc and &#47;&#47;e were the first computers I recall ever using.  I used to check out BASIC programming books from our elementary school library and deligently type in the program code character by character.  In 4th or 5th grade our school built a computer lab full of new Apple IIgs machines.  It was wonderful!  I learned quite a bit in that lab and when we added a few Mac LCs, I began to learn HyperCard.  I always wanted a IIgs at home, but we ended up getting a 286 instead.  Years later I was given several IIgs's, one of which was fully loaded.  I needed money, so I sold them on eBay.  Now I'm pining for them again.  I would like to add some Apple II's to my collection now.  My wife says my gadget budget is spent for a long time now that I have my new PowerBook, :) so I guess I'll have to make due with a good emulator.  I've found a lot of great Apple II sites out there, and I'm currently working to get a good Apple II emulator working with my Freevo setup.</p>
<p>I'll post more about it when I have either Tie Fighter or Karateka running on my game machine.</p>
