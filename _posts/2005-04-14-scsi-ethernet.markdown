I just received the SCSI Ethernet adapter I ordered using eBay.  It is a Dayna SCSI Pocket/Link and I'm very excited about it!  It is powered via ADB and comes with an innovative cable that can connect to DB-25 SCSI or HDI-30, meaning I can use it either on my old Mac Classic or on my PowerBook 165c.  I haven't gotten the drivers installed and working yet, but I'm very anxious to do so.  Just another way of connecting my old Macs to my network and keeping them useful. ;)
