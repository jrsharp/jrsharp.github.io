  content: I'd love to help with Beta Testing for your cellphone bible.

<p>To accompany the new site design news, I should mention that I've launched a site for my BibleReaderME project.  BibleReaderME is a Java J2ME application designed to allow users to read the Bible on their cell phone or other mobile device.  I've been working on it for the past year in my spare time and believe it is nearly ready to distribute.  I am currently seeking Beta testers who are willing to do compatibility testing as well as provide other feedback.  If you have a Java-capable cell phone or mobile device and are interested, email me or leave a comment on this post.</p>
