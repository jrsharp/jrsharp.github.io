Hey Internets,

I have this great company I started with my friend, Tyler Duffy, named <a href="http://www.campgroundautomation.com">Campground Automation Systems</a>.  With our team, I've been very busy building <a href="http://www.campgroundautomation.com/sunrise-hardware-kiosk-and-control#kiosk">outdoor Kiosks</a>, designing <a href="http://www.campgroundautomation.com/sunrise-hardware-kiosk-and-control#control">wireless utility control</a> devices, and writing <a href="http://www.campgroundautomation.com/sunrise-software">software</a> to tie it all together for the past 5 years -- which is why this blog has been so neglected.

We provide <a href="http://www.sunrisereservations.com">online reservations</a> for campgrounds and RV Parks through our <a href="http://www.sunrisereservations.com">SunriseReservations.com</a> portal site.

We don't just do online reservations through our central reservation system, (CRS) we have a complete <a href="http://www.campgroundautomation.com/Sunrise">campground management software</a> package named <a href="http://www.campgroundautomation.com/sunrise-software">Sunrise</a>.

Stop by our site and read all about it, then visit us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Campground-Automation-Systems/110944752283900">Facebook</a> and "Like" us!
