<p>I'm giving a presentation this Wednesday at the November <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nlug.org">NLUG<&#47;a> meeting on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;openwrt.org">OpenWrt<&#47;a>.  The title of my presentation is "OpenWrt: Linksys Router Hacking for Fun and Profit."  Yes, I know it is a bit of a clich&eacute;d title, but I like it.  I'm going to be providing a good overview of the OpenWrt distribution and project, as well as a demonstration of compilation and&#47;or installation.</p>
<p>The basic idea that I will try to communicate is that if you have a supported router, there's really no reason to be running a stock firmware!  I know many NLUG'ers have such routers, and I hope I can help them unlock their full potential.</p>
<p>If you live in the Nashville &#47; Middle Tennessee area, come on out!  7:00 PM Wednesday night -- directions are available on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nlug.org">NLUG<&#47;a> page.</p>
