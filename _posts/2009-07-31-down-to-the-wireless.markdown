<p>Hey everybody...  I haven't posted more recently because I have had some pretty major roadblocks.  Most of the things I expected to be easy have been anything but.  Also, I have been awaiting several prototyping components for the actual Apple II card for weeks now and alas, after having just checked the mail, I know that I won't even have a few minutes to put the parts together for a quick test today.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the real problem appears to be my Treo itself.  It seems to have some serious objections to communicating with either Bluetooth module I picked up.  (Though I have received confirmation that other Treos work fine.)  I am awaiting some last minute support from Bluegiga regarding this issue and am hopeful for good news.</p>
<p>The circuit design and board layout are still in early stages, as these other problems have been such a challenge.  </p>
<p>I will also be doing a complete writeup&#47;summary of the project later today, and while I am disappointed that some things have been such a challenge, I am also very encouraged that none of these things have proved impossible to overcome.  I have confidence that I'll be able to resolve them soon.  As for the competition, I think there are some accomplishments&#47;revelations worthy of note, and will detail those in my later summary.</p>
