<p>I just wanted to write a bit of praise here for AppleCare today.  Yesterday, I noticed that my PowerBook's power adapter had stopped working.  It appeared to be a worn cable.  I take good care of my PowerBook and accessories, so it was really just a matter of two years of solid use.  Anyway, AppleCare said they'd replace it, but the replacement part wouldn't arrive for 5-7 days and that I wouldn't be able to track it.  Well, as it turns out, they shipped it overnight via DHL and they did send me a tracking number.  I was very pleasantly surprised to receive my replacement power adapter about 24 hours after my call to AppleCare.  Let's hope they keep up the good response as I enter my third year.</p>
