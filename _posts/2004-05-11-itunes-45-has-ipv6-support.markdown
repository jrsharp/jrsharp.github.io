I don't know if previous versions of iTunes had IPv6, but I just tried it out using iTunes 4.5 and discovered that my connection to the IPv6 streams located at [redacted] worked just great!  I have been playing with IPv6 for a while now and think it's great.  My company is on the 6bone at [redacted] and my personal site is at [redacted].  Anyway, just thought I'd share this little bit of information with y'all.
