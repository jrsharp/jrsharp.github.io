<p>I don't know if previous versions of iTunes had IPv6, but I just tried it out using iTunes 4.5 and discovered that my connection to the IPv6 streams located at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.icecast6.remcom.org&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.icecast6.remcom.org<&#47;a> worked just great!  I have been playing with IPv6 for a while now and think it's great.  My company is on the 6bone at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ipv6.ndsmedia.com">ipv6.ndsmedia.com<&#47;a> and my personal site is at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ipv6.jonandjolene.com">ipv6.jonandjolene.com<&#47;a>.  Anyway, just thought I'd share this little bit of information with y'all.</p>
