I recently tried out this open source music management application as an alternative to iTunes on my Gentoo PPC box.  My initial impression is quite favorable.  One of the features I found most compelling was its ability to connect to iTunes shares via DAAP and Bonjour.  The only problem I experienced with this feature at present is the lack of support for iTunes 7 shares, as Apple has altered the DAAP protocol in 7.  This is currently being worked on and an update is expected soon.

Anyway, as I said, I'm very impressed with this app.  Not only does it have some great features, it's written in C# for Mono!  How cool is that?  Another real app written for Mono!
