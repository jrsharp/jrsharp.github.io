Okay, I recently purchased a new IIsi motherboard for cheap on ebay and tried my clock chipping procedure all over again, this time being extra careful.  When I was done, I was greeted with a successful boot in Mac OS 7.5.5!  Now, I haven't yet been able to find a utility that can confirm that I am in fact running at 25Mhz, but I definitely now have a 50Mhz oscillator in the machine and the machine works very well.  The IIsi seems maybe slightly faster, though it is hard to tell at those speeds.  Whatever the case, I still feel cool.  :)
