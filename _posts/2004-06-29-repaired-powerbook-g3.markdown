The PowerBook G3 Lombard that I picked up almost two years ago died on us several months ago.  My wife had been using it for all her computing needs and it was working great until she unplugged it one day from the wall and it never would power up again.  I carefully dismantled it to try to determine the problem, and surmised that it must be the small board connecting the power adapter to the logic board.  I really didn't have the time to try to get a part and attempt to fix it, so I decided to sell it off for parts on eBay.  But I apparently didn't have the time for that, either, because it sat around until I decided to buy a spare power board from eBay for $20.  Well, the part sat around for about a month before I could get time to install it, but I finally got around to it last night.  Repairing any laptop is a challenge, and the PowerBook is no exception.  In order to get to the power board, you have to remove virtually every other part of the machine.  After replacing the part and reassembling the computer, I was delighted to hear the signature Apple chime when I powered it up.  I started reinstalling Mac OS X Panther immediately and it booted right up.  But then I noticed a bad thing.  The ethernet doesn't appear to be working now.  I don't know if it was damaged by ESD or what could've caused it.  Before the machine went bad, we almost exclusively used a Cisco wireless card in it, so perhaps it hasn't been operable for some time.  At any rate, I'll try to see if it is repairable and if not, I'll just continue to use the Cisco card and/or another PCMCIA ethernet card.  Anyway, I'm just thrilled that I was able to repair it for as little as $20!  It's still a great machine with great value.

Edit:  The ethernet works just fine.  It was a problem with my switch at work.
