<p>I am now quite impatiently awaiting my PowerBook's arrival.  I feel very much like Amit Singh from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.kernelthread.com">kernelthread.com<&#47;a> and the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.kernelthread.com&#47;mac&#47;saga.html">drama<&#47;a> that accompanied his PowerBook arrival.  FedEx was supposed to deliver my package yesterday.  As it required a signature, I made absolutely sure that I was there the entire day so as not to miss it.  Checking the FedEx online tracking information, I saw that the package was on the truck for delivery since 8:45AM.  I continued to check that page periodically throughout the day just in case we had in fact missed the delivery.  Well, the page never changed and it grew later and later.  Finally, I knew that they wouldn't be coming that evening, so I called FedEx to see what was going on.  A woman was able to quickly tell me that the driver had attempted delivery at 3:45PM.  I told her I found that rather incredible considering my wife, myself and my dog were all at home the entire afternoon.  I don't believe the driver ever made it to my apartment because I was fairly vigilant in my anticipation.  I assured the woman that the driver clearly made a mistake.  I demanded satisfaction.  She said she was sorry but the delivery would have to be rescheduled for Tuesday.  Tuesday?!  Apparently, FedEx Home Delivery only runs from Tuesday to Saturday.  I asked her if I could pick up the package at the terminal.  Sure.  She began making a note to hold it at the terminal for pickup.  Then she tells me that the driver will get the note on Tuesday.  "So, you're telling me I'm going to have to wait until Tuesday for them to hold the package so I can pick it up?  The whole point of my asking if it could be held was so that I didn't have to wait until Tuesday!"  After going around and around with the woman, it was clear she could not satisfy me.  Apparently, FedEx completely shuts down this terminal on Sunday and Monday, so no one would be available at all for me to contact there to get it sooner.  So, now I have to wait until Tuesday.  In the meantime, my PowerBook is sitting at some FedEx facility 15 miles away.  Needless to say, I'm a little upset about the matter and this creates an extra inconvenience because I must be at home during my lunch hour to await delivery.  Oh well, I suppose I should take the opportunity to exercise patience.</p>
