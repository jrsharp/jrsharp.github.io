I had let my <a href="http://he.net">Hurricane Electric</a> tunnelbroker account lapse several years ago when shuffling around my OpenWrt builds.  At that time I determined that I didn't need the extra overhead imposed by the tunnelbroker.

Having recently upgraded from my trusty Linksys WRT54G, to an x86 Alix router platform, I decided to reactivate my IPv6 tunnel.  It was a piece o' cake.  I was then able to update my DNS records and bring JonSharp.net and JonandJolene.com back on IPv6.  It feels good to be back. ;)
