<p>I've been using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.moneydance.com&#47;">Moneydance<&#47;a> for some time now, for both my personal and business financial needs, and I wanted to go ahead and post this short endorsement of the product.</p>
<p>First of all, I switched to Moneydance from Quicken for Mac partly because Quicken has always been rather buggy on the Mac, but most of all, I was very disappointed with Quicken's reporting features.  Now, to be fair, Moneydance doesn't do exactly what I want in terms of reporting, but it's a fair bit better than Quicken, to be sure.</p>
<p>Secondly, Moneydance is far more cross-platform, being Java-based.  It allows me to work with the same data in the same program across Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Moneydance is less expensive than Quicken.  It has all the online banking capabilities I was using in Quicken, but nearly half the price.</p>
<p>Lastly, Moneydance has a developer API for custom extensions.  I love customizable software.  I have just begun writing a Moneydance extension that should resolve my remaining issues with reporting.</p>
<p>BMT Micro provides a generous demo of Moneydance which I recommend checking out.  If you like the software and would like to purchase it, do me a favor and use the following link to let them know that you heard about it here.</p>
