I've had some more time to use the preview of Safari 2.0 that shipped with the Tiger WWDC preview, and I wanted to share my impressions of it.  So far, I am really enjoying the new Safari.  Of course, the biggest new feature is the built-in RSS aggregator.  It really is nice.  As I have come to expect from Apple, the interface is intuitive and provides quick navigation of RSS feeds.  Another neat RSS feature is this:

<img src="&#47;images&#47;Safari_RSS_alternate.png" width="400" alt="Image depicting Safari's RSS button" &#47;>

When you connect to a site that lists its RSS feed in a link "alternate" tag, this [RSS] graphic is displayed in the address bar.  Clicking it will bring up the feed in Safari's RSS reader interface (pictured below).

<a href="&#47;images&#47;Safari_RSS.png"><img src="&#47;images&#47;Safari_RSS.png" width="300" alt="Safari's RSS aggregator" &#47;><&#47;a>

Anyway, I like the new RSS features of Safari.
