  content: Eli and I just logged on to the Bozax.com BBS last week.  We used a cable
    connection, but they had a number listed.  They are located in Atlanta.

<p>Actually, I found two of them.  I have been working with one of my old Macs lately -- my IIsi.  I connected my US Robotics 28.8kbps external modem to see if it still worked and fired up Z-Term 1.0.1.  I was able to dial into another machine connected internally on my company's PBX.  That was great, but I yearned for the experience I had growing up, connecting to many BBSs with my 2400 bps modem.  I knew I wasn't likely to find one, but Googling for Nashville area BBSs revealed two local numbers.  I tried them both out and got a CARRIER both times.  One didn't amount to much, but the other one was a discussion board that looked like it had some fairly recent activity.  Anyway, it was a thrill to take a brief stroll down memory lane and sigh at the loss of a culture.</p>
