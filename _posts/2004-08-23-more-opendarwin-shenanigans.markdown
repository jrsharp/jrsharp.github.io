I continue to enjoy playing with OpenDarwin.  I've now created a startup script for xdm and added it to the [SystemStarter](http://www.opendarwin.org/~kevin/SystemStarter/SystemStarter.html).  My system now boots directly into the xdm login display from the Apple logo bootsplash screen.  Now, the xdm display is absolutely ugly.  I have tried to no avail to modify the appearance of xdm.  No amount of persuasion seems to make xdm use the Xresources or Xsetup files.  As xdm has it's limitations, I would like to use kdm or gdm.  I am having difficulty getting either to compile, however.  My GNUstep installation is running quite well, however, and aside from not having Mozilla or Firefox, this is shaping up to be a pretty useful OS.
