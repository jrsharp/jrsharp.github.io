I went backpacking this past weekend with several good friends, [David Benton](http://dbenton.com), Phillip Paul, and Bruce Boggess.  We traveled to the Big Frog Wilderness, right near the Ocoee River.  Our hike led us up the mountain Friday night and we camped down in a valley near Rough Creek Saturday night.  It was a great weekend and a great hike.  I took my dog Tennyson with us and he had a great time.  He was a bit of a nuisance sometimes, as his nose gets him in trouble, but he is a great trail dog.  David has put together [a great map of our hike](http://go.dbenton.com/2006/02/27/big-frog-mountain-backpacking-trip-in-data/) and [pictures from the weekend](http://go.dbenton.com/wp-content/plugins/falbum/wp/album.php?album=72057594071445793).  Thanks Dav!
