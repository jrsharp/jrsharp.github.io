I just tested out watching a divx movie on my SparcStation 2.  It has a 40Mhz SPARC CPU and 28MB of RAM.  I ssh'd into another, faster machine and invoked mplayer with the "-vo aa" option to get ASCII art output over the console.  The refresh was a little slow (partly the framebuffer of the sparc, partly the slow connection to the other computer), but the images were very recognizable.  Anyway, it was a fun little exercise.
