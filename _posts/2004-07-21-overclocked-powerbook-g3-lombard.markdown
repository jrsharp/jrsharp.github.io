I overclocked my PowerBook G3 Lombard from 400Mhz to 466Mhz today.  I am posting this using it.  I have had absolutely no stability issues whatsoever.  Heat doesn't seem to be particularly worse, either.  I have tried to push the machine, too.  I played GLQuake and Quake 3 under OS 9 for more than an hour this evening.  Aside from the machine just not being able to play Quake 3 well, I had no problems.  I think I can tell a slight improvement in performance.  I'd love to attempt a higher overclocking, and I am tempted, but I am very satisfied with the success of my procedure this afternoon.  I like stability. :)  All the same, I would like to see what this machine is truly capable of.  Oh well, perhaps someday I'll attempt a 400Mhz to 500Mhz overclocking by upping the FSB to 83Mhz.  That should provide a noticeable improvement.
