<p>I just came across one of the most amazing things I think I have ever seen.  I appreciate the Internet all the more for making this possible.  Also, I appreciate the brave people that provided these unbelievable images.  I was absolutely fascinated as I went through the entire series of pages.  Perhaps I am making to much of this.  Go check it out for yourself <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.angelfire.com&#47;extreme4&#47;kiddofspeed&#47;">here<&#47;a>.  (I hope this link remains good.  It is hosted on angelfire, after all)</p>
