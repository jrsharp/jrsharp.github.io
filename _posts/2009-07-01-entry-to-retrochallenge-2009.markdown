I've submitted an entry to <a href="http://retrochallenge.net/2009/">RetroChallenge 2009</a>.  I came across the challenge last year, but didn't have the time to put together an entry.  I'm not certain I'll be able to complete my entry this year, but I had to give it a shot.  Here's a description:

I was inspired while playing around with <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~gp/VirtualII/">Virtual ][</a>.  I discovered that I could actually use my Treo 650 as a dialup modem from within Virtual ][ by using the Bluetooth serial connection from my MacBook Pro to the phone.  Having recently acquired an Apple //e, I decided to set this up on the real hardware, with a goal to designing an expansion card that would emulate the functionality of the <a href="http://www.apple2info.net/hardware/a2ssc/a2ssc.htm">Super Serial Card</a> while including the Bluetooth functionality, as well.

While I've got a number of ideas of where I want to take this eventually, for the purposes of the competition, I'm going to try to start modestly by simply getting the hardware to communicate.  I doubt that I will have full card prototyped and fab'd by the end of the competition, so I will attempt simply to complete a design (schematic / board layout).

I have begun evaluating and sourcing parts for the project.  I've also begun reading through the relevant docs.  Also, much thanks to the kind folks of #a2c.chat for their help in pulling the idea together.  I'll be posting more updates soon.
