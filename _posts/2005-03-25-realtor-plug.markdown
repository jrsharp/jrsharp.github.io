<p>I just wanted to take a moment and plug our realtor.  For those of you who don't know, my wife and I just bought a house near White House, TN, just North of Nashville.  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mrsteve.com">Steve Wright<&#47;a> of Love and Yount Realty was exceptionally helpful throughout the entire process and continues to be involved now more than a week after closing.  We just don't have enough good things to say about him, so we recommend that if you are looking for a realtor in this area, Steve is your man.  You can visit <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mrsteve.com">his website<&#47;a> to learn more or go ahead and <a href="mailto:info@mrsteve.com?subject=Jon and Jolene Sharp recommended you">email him<&#47;a>.</p>
