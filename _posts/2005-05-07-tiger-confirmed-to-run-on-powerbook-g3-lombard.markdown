  content: "I did as you suggested, modifying the bad machines line, but I still get
    a message that it cant install on my lombard.  Any ideas what I might be doing
    wrong?  I am new to the world of Macs (been a PC guy) so chances are its a mistake
    I made somewhere.  But I have verified the file on my 'modified' cd and there
    is no more reference to powerbook1,1  (I have made 2 copies, one modifying the
    line to powerbook3,1 and one with it removed completely).  Any help would be appriciated
    I would hate to have to dig out my HD from my laptop to do an install.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  content: "Dave,\r\n\r\nI really am sorry to hear that you're having trouble installing
    Tiger.  I'm afraid I'm really no expert at this, I simply dug around and found
    a way that worked for me.  I really don't have any ideas for you since it sounds
    like you followed my instructions well enough.  There may be something useful
    to you in the various comments left by other visitors to my blog.  As for digging
    out your HD, I know it's not what you wanted to do, but removing the HD in the
    Lombard is actually not that hard.  In fact, I have a couple of HDs I use for
    testing and I just swap them out whenever I want a change.  Anyway, best of luck
    and I am sorry I can't be more helpful."

<p>Ok, I've confirmed that Mac OS X 10.4, Tiger will run just fine on the PowerBook G3 Lombard.  I suppose "just fine" is debatable, but it's definitely up and running on my overclocked (466Mhz) Lombard and seems usable to me.  It is a bit sluggish, of course, and the spinning beachball appears more often than I would like.  The machine is even usable with VoiceOver running.</p>
<p>Anyway, there you have it, folks.  I will go back to running Gentoo PPC on my Lombard, but I know many Lombard users out there want to run Tiger.  Just follow the instructions provided in my previous post for creating a hacked Tiger installation DVD.</p>
<p>As a side note, there were several other models listed in the OSInstall.dist file that may be made to run Tiger, as well.  Check it out!</p>
