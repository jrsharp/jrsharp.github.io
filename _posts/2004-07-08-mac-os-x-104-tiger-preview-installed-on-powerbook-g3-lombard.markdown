  content: "Joseph,\r\n\r\nYes, the retail release of Tiger officially says that it
    requires a computer with built-in FireWire.  The WWDC preview of Tiger, however,
    ran just fine of my Lombard.  In fact, it ran quite well, for being a pre-release.\r\n\r\n--\r\nJon"

  content: "Hi Jon,\r\n\r\nI want to try to load Tiger on my lombard as well.  It
    is not my main machine by any means, but I want it to be part of the network running
    Tiger.  Do you think it will load the final release copy of Tiger?  \\\r\n\r\nI
    have not found anyone that has done it yet with the final release copy."

  content: "Marcus,\r\n\r\nI honestly do not know about the final release copy of
    Tiger.  I have since migrated to Gentoo Linux PPC on my Lombard, but I received
    my copy of Tiger today, so I will at least attempt to boot the DVD and report
    on my success&#47;failure here on the blog.\r\n\r\nGary,\r\n\r\nI did not try
    to watch any video DVDs on my Lombard using the Tiger preview.  I know that in
    the past, Jaguar and Panther would not view DVDs on the Lombard.  The issue is
    driver support for the MPEG2 decoder built into the Lombard.  Apple simply never
    provided support for it, as far as I know.  So, based on that, I would not expect
    DVD playback in Tiger, even if it turns out to be installable on the Lombard.\r\n\r\n--\r\nJon"

After recently resurrecting my PowerBook G3 Lombard, I decided to take the opportunity to try out the recently release Tiger Preview from WWDC.  The OS installed just fine and is quite usable on the old hardware.  The only thing I noticed right off was that any files I added to the system had some strange garbage outlining their icons in the finder.  You can see it in this <a href="&#47;images&#47;Tiger_Lombard.jpg">screenshot:<&#47;a>

<a href="&#47;images&#47;Tiger_Lombard.jpg"><img src="&#47;images&#47;Tiger_Lombard_small.jpg"&#47;><&#47;a>

I am pretty impressed with Tiger so far.  I know the strange graphics artifacts are probably just due to the fact that this prerelease software was never really intended to be installed on such old hardware.  I really want to play with Xcode 2.0 preview, but I'm afraid the 400Mhz G3 just doesn't cut it.  Also, there is no way I can play with the new graphics APIs Apple has included with Tiger.  But so far, so good.  I'm enjoying casually exploring some of the new features of the OS and plan to put up some more of my impressions as time allows.
