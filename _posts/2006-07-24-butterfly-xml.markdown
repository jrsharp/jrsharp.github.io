<p>I just ran across the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.butterflyxml.org&#47;">Butterfly XML<&#47;a> editor.  It is a simplistic XML IDE that doesn't seem to yet match the functionality of the more powerful commercial XML IDEs available, but it is open source, and for simple XML editing, it seems like it would do the trick.  It is cross-platform, as it is written in Java.  If nothing else, it's certainly one to keep your eyes on.</p>
