<p>When you fill your office with vintage Macs, your co-workers might get the impression you collect them.  Last week, a co-worker of mine brought me a Performa 640CD (DOS).  Because this is one of the few DOS-compatible Macs made, I was glad to add it to my collection.  After my initial inspection, I decided almost immediately to clock-chip it.  It had a 68LC040 CPU running at 33Mhz.  After consulting Marc Schrier's excellent <a href="http:&#47;&#47;homepage.mac.com&#47;schrier&#47;mhz.html">clock-chipping resource page<&#47;a>, I found that I only needed to move two surface mount resistors on the logic board.  I did this quite easily with a nice soldering iron.  When I reassembled the machine, it almost completely booted the first time.  I had to go back and add a heat sink I pried off of a Pentium 200 chip.  Now, I have no instability.  I installed DOS 7.1 on it and it's running well.  I want to replace the DX2-66 486 chip with a 100Mhz 486, but that may add to the heat too much.  Add one more overclocked Mac to my collection!</p>
