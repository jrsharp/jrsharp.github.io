In doing a bit more research on the [MOSIX]({% post_url 2006-03-20-we-need-mosix-for-darwin-mac-os-x %}) thing, I discovered http://hpc.sourceforge.net/ this wonderful page</a> which details the many technologies available for cluster and grid computing on Mac OS X.  For example, the site describes [MPI](http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/) and [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/).  There's a lot of other info on the site that should be useful for those wanting to use Mac OS X for high performance computing (HPC).
