My Hurricane Electric tunnel is back up again.  This time, the tunnel is being taken care of by my Linksys Wrt54g wireless access point &#47; router running OpenWrt.  This is the way it should be.  Now you can visit my ipv6-enabled sites over the 6bone at http://ipv6.jonandjolene.com and http://ipv6.jonsharp.net.  Let me know if you reach me over the 6bone.
