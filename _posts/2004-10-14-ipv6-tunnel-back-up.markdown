<p>My <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tunnelbroker.net">Hurricane Electric<&#47;a> tunnel is back up again.  This time, the tunnel is being taken care of by my Linksys Wrt54g wireless access point &#47; router running OpenWrt.  This is the way it should be.  Now you can visit my ipv6-enabled sites over the 6bone at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ipv6.jonandjolene.com">ipv6.jonandjolene.com<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ipv6.jonsharp.net">ipv6.jonsharp.net<&#47;a>.  Let me know if you reach me over the 6bone.</p>
