Someone recently sent me a link to this project:

http://mtoswiki.com

It sounds like a very interesting idea.  This guy has decided that the traditional open source development model isn't really open enough.  He argues that it takes too long to win the trust of many project developers in order to become a contributor.  His project aims to open things up so that anyone and everyone can contribute with very little trouble.

He acknowledges that it might not be the best approach for every open source project out there, but that it could be very promising for some.

Anyway, check it out and see what you think.
