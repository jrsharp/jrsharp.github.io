<p>Oh, I really want one of these:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thinkgeek.com&#47;gadgets&#47;tools&#47;754d&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.thinkgeek.com&#47;gadgets&#47;tools&#47;754d&#47;<&#47;a></p>
<p>It is a "Swedish FireSteel."  That's a cool toy.  I'm generally quite successful using matches, and I don't often go camping during monsoon or blizzard seasons, so it may not be the most practical gadget, but if I ever were caught in a freezing monsoon, I know that I could have a roaring fire, or at least a spark.</p>
