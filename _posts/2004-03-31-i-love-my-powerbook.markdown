<p>Well, I have had my beautiful new 17" PowerBook G4 for just over a week now, and I have to say that it has exceeded my expectations!  When I first opened it, it seemed even larger than I remembered from demoing one in the store, yet the more I use it, the lighter and more portable it seems to me.  It is remarkably lightweight for it's size.  The 1" thinness is just amazing and elegant.  It stays much cooler than I thought it would.  Only when I really push it with 3D gaming does it get hot.  Even then, 20-30 seconds after exiting the game, the fan turns off and temperature begins to return to normal.  The fan has not come on under any other circumstances yet.  My concerns regarding my ability to use the PowerBook on the couch or lying in bed have been laid to rest, as well.  In some ways, I find it easier to use the PowerBook than my 12" iBook in such circumstances, as the greater surface area seems to help me balance the notebook better.  I absolutely love the screen!  I just can't get over how much room I have to work with now.  I really enjoyed my 12" iBook, but I had to get creative with managing windows.  Fortunately, Mac OS X does so well at providing efficient and flexible window management, especially now that it has Expose.  The hinge design blows me away!  The action is so smooth!  Combined with the latch, this is without doubt the nicest notebook design I have seen.  I recently had the task of working on a Sony Vaio laptop with a 16" screen.  The hinge was so stiff and sticky.  I had to pry the screen away from the base.  If I lifted the screen, the base came up with it.  Needless to say, it helped me appreciate my PowerBook even more.  I have seen several other desktop replacement PC laptops advertised recently and I smile when I look at their specs.  HP's 17" notebook weighs almost 10 lbs and is nearly 2" thick.  Dell doesn't have a 17" notebook, but their 15.4" Latitude weighs about the same as mine, but is nearly 2" thick.  I have no complaints right now regarding my PowerBook.  I am really, very, truly satisfied with it.  I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship! ;)</p>
