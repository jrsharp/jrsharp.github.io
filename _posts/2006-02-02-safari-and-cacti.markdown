<p>I've recently set up <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cacti.net&#47;">Cacti<&#47;a> on my home office network for monitoring bandwidth usage, system load, memory usage, etc.  Cacti is a phenomenal tool that allows you to create graphs for these various SNMP functions.  I've been using Safari quite a bit lately, since discovering <a href="http:&#47;&#47;hetima.com&#47;safari&#47;stand-e.html">Safari Stand<&#47;a>.  But from the moment I set up Cacti, I noticed problems with Safari not loading the graph pages properly.  It would report errors when trying to get the images, and often only 1 or 2 images would display, and even then, they were usually cut off.  At first I thought I just needed to restart Safari, but that didn't resolve the issue.  Firefox has no problem loading the Cacti pages just fine, so it does not appear to be a server issue.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm experiencing what <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oreillynet.com&#47;pub&#47;wlg&#47;7152?wlg=yes">this guy<&#47;a> was experiencing.  It sounds familiar, anyway.  Now I won't go so far as to say Safari sucks like he did, but it is frustrating that I can't rely on it to display my network graphs.  Anyway, if anyone else has experienced this, or perhaps knows of any fix for such problems, sound off below in the comments.</p>
