Like many, I have been following the developments of the <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi project</a> with anticipation.  When the RPi was released recently, I was ready to try to get my order in at the earliest possible moment.  Unfortunately, it seems that the chosen distributors underestimated the demand and I ended up participating in the "DDOS" that crippled these sites.  In the end, I was able to "register my interest" and that allowed me several days later to place a pre-order myself.

My Raspberry Pi is expected to ship in May, so I'll have a bit of a wait, yet, but after waiting this long, what's a few more weeks?  I have a number of ideas in mind for mine, and I'm sure like-minded geeks are going to find endless uses for the innovative device, but I'm most excited about the foundation's vision for using the Pi as a tool for getting kids interested in programming.  I applaud their efforts and look forward to seeing the fruits of their labor in the months ahead.
