<p>It has really been a while since I posted something of real substance to the blog, and while that may seem to indicate that I haven't been doing much lately, the truth is quite the contrary.  I've been so busy with various projects that I haven't had time to write about them.  I feel really bad about it, too, because I have been wanting to share some of these cool projects with the world.  So, rather than waiting for more time to write, I'm just going to go ahead and mention a couple of the projects here in brief and write more later.</p>
<p>First of all, my biggest accomplishment has probably been the modifications I've made to my Linksys WRT54G wireless router.  I'm still running <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.openwrt.org">openwrt<&#47;a> on the router, and the latest stable release is running better than ever.  But the real improvement to the router came after I soldered an SD&#47;MMC card into the unit.  I actually used a miniSD card with an SD card adapter to come up with a pretty elegant solution.  I soldered the SD card adapter directly to the motherboard in the various places specified by this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;openwrt.org&#47;OpenWrtDocs&#47;Customizing">documentation<&#47;a>.  By using the miniSD card I'm able to maintain ease of expansion while keeping the entire mod self-contained within the device with no externally visible modifications.  The 128MB SD card allows me to run <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.asterisk.org">asterisk<&#47;a> on the device itself, along with IPv6 routing, QoS, SNMP, while still being able to host a myriad of additional tools and utilities.  I'm very happy with this hack.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I've been playing with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;asterisk.org">asterisk<&#47;a>, and I've really enjoyed learning more about VoIP technology.  It's been fascinating and I look forward to learning more about it in the future.</p>
<p>Just last night I modified an old PS&#47;2 KVM switch of mine to be a PS&#47;2 &#47; ADB KVM switch.  I simply ordered 5 ADB (S-Video) panel mount jacks from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mouser.com">Mouser<&#47;a> and replaced 5 of the PS&#47;2 ports with these, effectively providing a single PS&#47;2 port, a single ADB port, and a VGA port for 4 computers.  I was actually surprised how easy it was to do this mod.  I'm absolutely thrilled to have this switch now because without it, my "Classic Mac Museum" was being held back.  Now I can do much more with my old Macs, and it only cost me less than $10!</p>
<p>As a last item of interest, I've been playing with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;omnigroup.com&#47;omniweb">OmniWeb<&#47;a> lately and I'm really enjoying it!  I love Firefox, of course, but I just love everything Omni makes, so I had to try it.  I plan to continue using it throughout the 30 day trial period, but my first impressions are very positive.</p>
<p>Well, there it is... the first post in a long time that explains some of my project work lately.  I hope you found it useful.</p>
