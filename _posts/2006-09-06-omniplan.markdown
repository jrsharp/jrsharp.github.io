<p>The talented and creative team at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.omnigroup.com">OmniGroup<&#47;a> have done it again and released a new application I'm really excited about.  The new app is called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.omnigroup.com&#47;applications&#47;omniplan&#47;">OmniPlan<&#47;a>, and it is their answer to project management.  </p>
<p>So far, OmniPlan is only available as a Beta, but so far, it's been a solid performer for me.  I've been a user of PMX for some time now, and it appears that the developer of PMX has been working with OmniGroup to provide an upgrade path for PMX users.  I couldn't be more pleased to see OmniGroup filling this need.  I hope their efforts on OmniPlan only continue to prove that you don't need to run Windows to run all your necessary office applications.</p>
