<p>Hello to the few visitors to my website!  This is my first post to my new weblog.  I have thought about starting a blog for a while now and have finally gotten around to it.  I know that I won't have too much time to post to it often, but nonetheless, I felt it would be a benefit to my website.  jonSharp.net has been a place for me to put up information I feel may be relevant for others such as my experience with installing Mac OS X on my PowerTower Pro (<a href="&#47;mac.html">Mac Page<&#47;a>).  This blog should provide a better mechanism for such things and allow me to post them sooner.  I also hope this blog allows me to share some of my opinions and insights in the world of computing from time to time.  I hope you enjoy my site and enjoy my new blog!  Thanks for visiting and stay tuned!<br />
Jon</p>
