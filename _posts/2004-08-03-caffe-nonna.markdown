<p>I'm not accustomed to writing restaurant reviews on my website, but I had dinner last night at Caffe Nonna in Nashville.  Wow!  It was really good food!  Jolene and I went for my birthday.  It is a small, Italian restaurant with a lot of character.  The bread and olive oil was excellent.  The olive oil mixture had parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar.  Jolene and I shared their portobello salad.  It was perhaps the best salad I've ever had.  The portabello's were very tender and marinated perfectly.  The generous amount of gorgonzola just made the salad.  Jolene had a smoked gouda-filled ravioli and portabellos in a creamy pesto sauce while I had the spicy marinara sauce on angel hair pasta with calamata olives.  Both dishes were excellent.  Mine was spicier than I had bargained for, but still very unique and flavorful.  Jolene's dish was delicious.  The pesto sauce was very creamy.  All the ingredients tasted very fresh.</p>
<p>The best part, of course, was dessert.  We each had our own, because we wanted to sample their selection.  I had the Tiramisu and Jolene had the citrus-ricotta cheesecake.  Again, both desserts were excellent.  The Tiramisu was light and creamy.  The cheesecake was very unique.  The ricotta made the cheesecake very light and the citrus mixture poured over it was perfect.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful dining experience at Caffe Nonna and recommend it to anyone in the Nashville area.</p>
