<p>Dandelions are a very edible plant.  Many things can be done with them.  The leaves can be used in a salad, the flowers can be made into fritters, and people even make a dandelion wine.  It's hard to miss this one.  In fact, you probably have more of these in your yard&#47;garden then you would like.</p>
