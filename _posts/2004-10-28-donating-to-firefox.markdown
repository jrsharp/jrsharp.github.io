<p>Yesterday, I gave the $10 student donation to the Spread Firefox campaign for the New York Times ad campaign.  The Spread Firefox group is planning to buy a full-page ad in an upcoming issue of NYT to announce the 1.0 release.  I am honored to be a part of the process.  Die IE!  And I get my name in the ad!  How cool is that?</p>
