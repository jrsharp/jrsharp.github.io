<p>This is now the second year Jolene and I have grown a vegetable garden at home.  Last year we had Squash, Tomatoes, Eggplant, Peppers and various herbs.  This year we've added a few new items and have even begun several varieties from seed.  We have several varieities of Tomato plants, Squash, Zucchini, Eggplant, Peppers, Carrots, Pole Beans, Cauliflower, two types of Lettuce, Basil, Mint, Chives and Cilantro.  Despite a rocky start, (several hail storms) the garden is growing quite well.  We've been eating fresh lettuce almost daily now and the Tomatoes are nearly ripe.  The herbs have done well, too, providing us several fresh batches of Pesto.</p>
<p>I have really enjoyed learning how things grow and how to care for them.  Most of all, I love the taste of homegrown vegetables.  Nothing can compare.  If you come visit us this summer, we'll be sure to share in our harvest.</p>
