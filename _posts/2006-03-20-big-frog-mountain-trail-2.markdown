<p>This trip took me and several friends up into the Big Frog Wilderness during hunting season.  A friendly local hunter recommended we deviate from our trail a bit to a nice spot that would be away from the hunters camped ahead on our trail.  He took us up through the woods on what might have been trails at one point.  We ended up in a nice field at the top of a hill and it turned out to be a great camping spot.  The second day, we hiked up Big Frog Mountain and circled back around.  My friends David Benton, Dan Cates, Montie Schmiege and Ryan Herman joined me on that trip.  We also spotted several fresh Bear markings.</p>
