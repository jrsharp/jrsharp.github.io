  content: "Steven,\r\n\r\nI'm using OS 8.6 on my 1400.  It's working just fine for
    me.  In fact, I recently got a nice stand for my 1400 that swivels out off of
    my desk.  With the ADB KVM I just built recently, I'm making good use of all my
    Macs. :)\r\n\r\n--\r\nJon"

I recently made an investment in the PowerBook 1400 I inherited several months ago.  After running across http://www.penmachine.com/techie/airport1400.html, describing using a Lucent WaveLan 802.11b PCMCIA card with the 1400, I ordered a used one on eBay.  I also ordered a video expansion card that allows me to use an external display.  When I inherited the PowerBook, it had a cracked LCD.  I cheaply replaced the original passive-matrix display with an active-matrix display from one of the 1400c models.  This is a great upgrade for my 1400cs/117.  Maybe I'll get a G3 upgrade for it someday.  ;)  But for now, I now have a great little older PowerBook with the ability to connect to my home wireless network and do monitor spanning onto my external monitor.  I know, why do I bother?  It's the collector in me.
