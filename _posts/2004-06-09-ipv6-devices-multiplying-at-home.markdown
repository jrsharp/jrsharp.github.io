<p>Every computer &#47; device on my home network is now running IPv6 and is routable via the 6bone.  I have added my dual-celeron machine running apache2, (none of the following links will work for you unless you are on the 6bone)  [<a href="http:&#47;&#47;monstersix.jonsharp.net">monstersix.jonsharp.net<&#47;a>] my 68-pin TINI [<a href="http:&#47;&#47;tini68.jonsharp.net">tini68.jonsharp.net<&#47;a>], and my 72-pin TINI-based device [<a href="http:&#47;&#47;tad.jonsharp.net">tad.jonsharp.net<&#47;a>].</p>
<p>The really cool part of this post is that I now have a servlet running on my TAD device which allows users to put a message up on the LCD display of the device.  I wrote this simple servlet over the past few days and plan to add more features to it as time allows.  I am not aware of any other TINIs out there on the 6bone, so I am going to boldly declare that mine is the first! ;)  Certainly it is the only one with a servlet that interfaces with an LCD display.  Browsing the 6bone can be boring sometimes because there are relatively few sites out there right now, so I hope this provides yet another novel experience for other 6boners out there.  If you're not on the 6bone, check it out!</p>
