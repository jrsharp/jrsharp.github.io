<p>I ran across <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.splitbrain.org&#47;projects&#47;dokuwiki">DocuWiki<&#47;a> when viewing the documentation for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;quicksilver.blacktree.com&#47;">Quicksilver<&#47;a>.  The output is very attractive and well organized.  This looks like a great option for software project documentation.  It appears as though it could handle most all documentation needs for small development shops.  From the website:</p>
