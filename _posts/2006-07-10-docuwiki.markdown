I ran across <a href="http://www.splitbrain.org/projects/dokuwiki">DocuWiki</a> when viewing the documentation for <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>.  The output is very attractive and well organized.  This looks like a great option for software project documentation.  It appears as though it could handle most all documentation needs for small development shops.  From the website:
