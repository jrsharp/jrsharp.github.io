I just installed mod_gzip for Apache on jonSharp.net.  It should speed things up slightly.  Thought it would help save some precious bandwidth at home.  After testing it out on jonSharp.net, I plan to set it up for JonandJolene.com.  We get much more traffic to that site, but mod_gzip may not help a whole lot because the site is mostly images and mod_gzip doesn't help very much for compressed graphics.
