		<outline text="Do you believe Genesis to be true, accurate, historical?" />
		<outline text="Is it just a myth?">
			<outline text="many believe it is">
				<outline text="Wikipedia - Many scholars have questioned the accuracy of the historical account, and the use of such a retracing of the events presented in Genesis to date human history on earth has been rejected by the great majority of historians and archaeologists. Furthermore, independent scientific evidence from fields as diverse as cosmology, geology and biology is entirely incompatible with the timeline described in Genesis (e.g. the age of the Earth is estimated as more than 4 billion years). This subject is further discussed in The Bible and history and Young Earth creationism" />

		<outline text="Who was it written by?">
			<outline text="Moses?" />
			<outline text="Sumerians?">
				<outline text="Genesis as a completed book makes no claims about its authorship; it is an article of Orthodox Jewish faith that the book was dictated, in its entirety, by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. For a number of reasons, this view is no longer accepted by many biblical scholars and liberal Protestants. Instead, they accept a theory whose roots are based on cultural evolution and philosophical naturalism which teaches that the text of Genesis as we see it today was redacted together around 440 BC from earlier sources, namely the Sumerians" />

	<outline text="Genesis - importance in scripture">
		<outline text="Interestingly, Genesis is the most quoted book in the Old and New Testaments. In every instance, it is never in the context of metaphor or allegory or non-physical. Whether Moses himself in Exodus 20:11 correlating the 6 creation days to the 6 day workweek, David in Psalms or Jesus and Peter in the New Testament, Genesis Creation and events in Chapters 1-11, are assumed taken at face value to be literal historical fact not requiring interpretation or interpolation." />

	<outline text="Misc Questions">
		<outline text="The main message of Genesis is the creatorship of God.  Is it possible to accept what it says about God being Creator, while ignoring or denying the details of the Genesis narratives?  Is it possible that the author of Genesis did not intend it to be taken as literal fact, as some claim?  Why or why not?" />
		<outline text="How do the events of Genesis anticipate or prepare the way for the coming of Jesus?  Can Jesus be seen in the Genesis story?" />
		<outline text="What does the NT teach us about the OT in general and the book of Genesis in particular?  Were the means of salvation available to people in the OT times different from the means offered to thos living during or after the time of Christ?  What was the role of faith as opposed to works?">
