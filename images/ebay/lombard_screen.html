			This auction is for a PowerBook G3 14.1" Screen with power inverter board,
			plastics and hinges.  This screen came from a G3 Lombard (Bronze Keyboard)
			model PowerBook, though I it should work with the newer Pismo (Firewire)
			PowerBooks.  This screen is in great shape
			with only minor wear on the plastics and slight keyboard marks.  There are no
			dead pixels.  The clarity of this screen is actually so far above my brand new
			iBook 800!  The hinges are also in good shape.  The screen does not include the
			LCD display data cable.  The LCD screen is manufactured by LG Electronics and
			requires Apple Part Number 632-0112-B 821-0147-B display cable.  If you are
			looking to replace your display, you should already have a good cable.  You
			can determine if your cable is for the LG LCD by seeing if it says "LG" on
			cable where it connects to the motherboard.  It may say Samsung.  The Samsung
			cable is functionally compatible, but is shaped slightly differently, preventing
			proper closing of display casing.
