			This auction is for a PowerWave 604/132 model Macintosh clone from PowerComputing,
			very well upgraded.  The machine comes with a PowerLogix PowerForce G3 upgrade card
			running at 400Mhz, backside cache is 1MB @ 200Mhz.  It has been upgraded to 256MB
			of RAM.  (upgradeable to 1GB)  Memory is interleaved to improve performance. 
			I also added a PCI USB card
			that added 2 USB ports so I could use a newer Apple USB keyboard and Logitech wheel
			mouse.  It has a 4GB SCSI HD with
			Mac OS 8.6 preinstalled with the all required drivers, utilities and recent
			software updates.  I am also including the original 132Mhz 604e Processor and cache
			card that shipped with this machine originally.  I am including an Apple ADB keyboard
			and mouse.  The machine has also had its original CDROM drive replaced with an Apple-
			branded one needed to successfully install OS X.  The ZIP drive seems to work off and on, 
			but I never have thoroughly tested it.

			This is truly a great machine!  I really hate to part with it, but my wife doesn't
			appreciate my collection of computers as much as I do.  :)  PowerComputing made
			very excellent clone machines.  I especially appreciate the more "standard" form
			factor of the machine as I have been a long-time PC person as well.  This machine
			was my first really modern Mac and I have taken very good care of it.  It was my
			main machine as recently as December 2002.  It runs OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) very well.
			The 132Mhz 604e CPU also runs OS X 10.1.  (Not very quickly, mind you)  I have
			successfully installed and used Mac OS 8.6 - 9.2.2, (9.2.2 is very fast)
			10.1 - 10.2.3, Darwin 5 & 6,
			and YellowDog Linux.  Many other Linux distros and NetBSD/OpenBSD can also be
			installed.  This is really still a very good machine.  If you just want to have a
			good Mac to run classic Mac OS on or if you are a PC geek interested in learning
			Mac OS X or LinuxPPC or some other great geek project, this is your machine.  Like
			I said, you can be guaranteed it has been given much geek TLC from me.  If you have
			any questions, please email me.
