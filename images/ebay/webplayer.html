			<p>
			This auction is for a Virgin Webplayer internet appliance with 2.5"
			IDE cable.
			This webplayer unit is in good shape and great working condition.
			The video memory chip
			responsible for the bottom half of the screen has gone bad.  This
			problem is a common one and is actually quite tolerable in text
			mode.  The LCD is in fine shape and the chip problem only garbles the
			output on the bottom half.  The disk-on-chip
			(DOC) and DOC door are missing.  This is not a big deal, really,
			especially if you plan to run a real operating system on it via a
			laptop hard drive.  It does not have the modem module.  Adding a
			USB ethernet adapter is trivial.
			</p>
			<p>
			The webplayer comes with the base unit with screen, the wireless
			keyboard/trackball, power supply, and 2.5" IDE cable.  I have
			successfully installed and used Windows 98, Windows ME, Slackware
			Linux 8.0 and Redhat Linux on this unit.
			</p>

			I originally picked this up to turn it into an mp3 player for my truck,
			but decided I didn't have the time.  My plan was to simply power it with
			a small 140W power inverter, place the motherboard in a custom case behind
			the seat (without the screen), connect a usb character display and keypad
			and usb compact flash reader (for mp3 storage) and tie it all together
			with my own software running on linux.  If you are interested in my
			plans, you can email me and I'll give you more details.
			<br><br>
			The possibilities are really quite endless with this wonderful little
			device, especially for the enterprising geek!
