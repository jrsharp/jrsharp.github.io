The Spread Firefox group is planning to buy a full-page ad in an upcoming issue of NYT to announce the 1.0 release.  I am honored to be a part of the process.  Die IE!  And I get my name in the ad!  How cool is that?</p>

      <h2><a href="http://172.21.21.105:4000/backpacking-again/">Backpacking again</a></h2>
      <p>
        

        

	<p>Well, this past weekend marked the beginning of a new backpacking season.  The weather was great and Jolene and I had been anxiously anticipating the trip.  Our destination was the Cohutta Wilderness in North Georgia.  Our plan was to “car camp” at the Jack’s River primitive campground area on Friday night because we would be getting in rather late.  Then, on Saturday, we’d pack up and pack in on any one the many trails into the Cohutta Wilderness.  We were taking my youngest brother, Justin, and it was his first backpacking trip.  Also accompanying us was our Beagle, Tennyson.  He loves the outdoors and we were looking forward to seeing how he did carrying his own pack on his first real backpacking trip.</p>

<p>While the weekend was very enjoyable, Friday night was a disaster.  First of all, it had been some time since we had been to the Cohutta Wilderness, and I mistakenly took the wrong entrance into the National forest area.  We could still get to the Jack’s river area, but it would take a bit longer.  After more than an hour of extra driving on dirt and gravel roads looking for alternative campsites, we made it to the road that led into the Jack’s River campground.  Four miles down this road, however, at midnight, we were greeted with bright orange “Road Closed” sign.  Apparently, they were in the process of repairing the bridge there.  The only thing to do was to turn around and head back out.  On our way out, we looked back to see a “Road Closed 4 miles ahead” sign just beyond the road we had turned from.  If we had come in the right way to begin with, we would have seen the sign and perhaps had the time to travel north on 411 to the Tennessee entrance to Jack’s River.  Anyway, we gave up on finding somewhere that night because we were so tired, so we drove 45 minutes south to stay with my parents.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Saturday, however, was exceptional.  We headed back out to the Cohutta Wilderness around noon and parked at the Hickory Creek Trail trailhead.  We geared up and hiked in about 1.5 - 2 miles to a great campsite on the Conasauga River.  We had plenty of time to relax as we set up camp and let Tennyson off leash to run around and splash in the creek.  (which is all the Conasauga River is at that point)  We saw just a couple of groups of hikers pass by in the afternoon.  The rain held off and we had hot dogs and fire-baked foil dinners of potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic and herbs.  On Sunday morning we had whole wheat pancakes from scratch and green pepper and onion omelets with veggie sausage links.  As I told my brother, backpacking is all about the food.  :)</p>

<p>All of us had a wonderful time, especially Tennyson.  Justin plans to do more backpacking, so I guess we gave him a good first impression.  It had been a long time since we had been backpacking last, and Jolene and I hope this is the start of an active backpacking season.</p>

	<p>My Hurricane Electric tunnel is back up again.  This time, the tunnel is being taken care of by my Linksys Wrt54g wireless access point / router running OpenWrt.  This is the way it should be.  Now you can visit my ipv6-enabled sites over the 6bone at http://ipv6.jonandjolene.com and http://ipv6.jonsharp.net.  Let me know if you reach me over the 6bone.</p>

	<p>As you may infer from the headline, I finally got up the courage to install <a href="http://openwrt.org">OpenWrt</a> on my Linksys Wrt54G WAP/router.  I had been running a <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com">Sveasoft</a> firmware since I purchased the device several months ago.  The sveasoft firmware provided some great extra functionality, but my original intention for this router was to act as an IPv6 router.  OpenWrt was in early development when I bought my Wrt54G, and I knew it wouldn’t be long before this functionality was provided by this amazing project.  Today, I am awaiting the activation of my <a href="http://tunnelbroker.net">Hurricane Electric</a> IPv6 tunnel.  My router has been configured for this IPv6 tunnel and will route my assigned /64 onto my home network.  OpenWrt has also allowed me to install <a href="http://www.openswan.org">Openswan</a> on my router to provide IPSEC VPN functionality.  Anyway, I’m thrilled to have all this extra functionality on my little router.</p>

      <h2><a href="http://172.21.21.105:4000/gifts-from-novell/">Gifts from Novell</a></h2>
      <p>
        

        

	<p>I am always glad when my latest <a href="http://www.novell.com/connectionmagazine/">Novell Connection</a> magazine arrives in the mail, but I was particularly pleased to find that Novell had included an evaluation copy of their latest SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9.  It came on four discs, and I couldn’t wait to give it a shot when I got to work the next day.  SUSE was an early favorite of mine years ago, before I became fed up with rpm-based distros altogether.  I haven’t touched it since SUSE 6.0, but I was excited about this one because of the Novell connection.  I have been a long-time fan of Netware, and believe that Novell’s directory services, NDS/eDirectory, are their greatest asset.  Microsoft’s Active Directory continues to disappoint in comparison to the NDS that I grew to love years ago on Netware 4.11!  Today, Netware 6.5 is available today with all of Netware’s services, but they are quickly migrating these services to Linux.  This is why I was excited to get this copy of SUSE.  I was hoping to install it to find NDS/eDirectory, ZENworks, and Groupwise.  I didn’t find these things, but I was impressed, nonetheless.</p>

<p>The complete installation was incredibly polished, as many modern commercial Linux distros are.  The thing I was most impressed with about the install was the option to resize existing partitions.  It allowed me to resize an existing NTFS partition on the disk.  When it booted, I was greeted by a KDE 3.2.1 environment.  Perhaps the greatest part of the distro came next, when I discovered YaST2.  YaST had administration modules for many common network services, and some that aren’t so common.</p>

<p>I have been very impressed and I’m looking forward to installing eDirectory to make it a more complete Novell box.</p>
