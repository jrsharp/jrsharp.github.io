      <p>
        

        

	<p>Well, the reason I haven’t posted of late is that I’ve run into a couple of snags.  I had really hoped that next post would be one announcing my success in establishing a direct connection from my //e to my Treo.  You see, I was very close.  As I mentioned in my last post, I was nearly able to transfer disk images over to my //e using ADTPro.  Well, I got that working with minimal effort and created myself a MODEM.MGR boot disk which would talk to my bluetooth module connected to the SSC.  So all of that works just fine.  The //e talks to the bluetooth module no problem.</p>

<p>So the issue I’m having is between the Treo and the module.  It seems there’s something about the Treo that the module doesn’t like, or vice versa, perhaps.  I can establish a SPP/DUN connection to my wife’s phone, a Sanyo Katana, no problem.  Of course, I can establish a similar connection with the Treo, but I cannot issue any commands at all.  The module says it is connected but I’m clearly getting nothing through.  I’ve never been terribly impressed with the Bluetooth stack on the Palm OS, so I imagine it’s just a little idiosyncratic and I haven’t found a way to make this module talk to the Treo yet.  Bluegiga is a Finnish company and their tech support has been friendly and responsive, but not particularly helpful.</p>

<p>At this point, I feel as if I’m out of options with the WT-32 module, so I’ve ordered a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=582">BlueSMIRF module</a>.  I’m determined to get this connection working under the deadline.  Now, I’m not as enthusiastic about the feature set on the BlueSMIRF, which is why I had picked the BlueGiga module in the first place.  But as it turns out, the BlueGiga module does not support the HID profile in host mode, which would have allowed me to interface my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard with the //e.  The WT-32 still has some neat audio features that the BlueSMIRF lacks, but I wasn’t quite as interested in those.  Anyway, I’m hoping that the BlueSMIRF and Treo get along a little better.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have been trying to work on the other thing I wanted to accomplish, the board layout/design for a custom card for this application.  This was always the part I wasn’t entirely certain I would have time to put together in a month.  As August approaches, I’m feeling less and less confident.  However, I do continue to make progress on this, but it is requiring learning a lot of new tools.  I’m currently trying to implement the discrete logic of the SSC as VHDL code in an Altera CPLD.  Given that the schematic for the SSC is available, the challenge here is simply getting up to speed with these new tools.</p>

<p>I’m also still awaiting the delivery of some essential prototyping components that have been delayed.  But all things considered, I’m still confident I can have my //e and Treo talking soon and I should also be able to have a board layout/VHDL design for the card mostly complete by the time the clock runs out on this friendly competition.</p>

      <p>
        

        

	<p>Ok, so I arrived home to discover that about half of the things I had ordered for the project had arrived.  It was enough to start putting things together, so I started today with the WT-32 Bluetooth module.  I ordered this from Sparkfun with their breakout board, so it was easy to interface this with an RS232 level adapter board I had on hand.  I powered this with 3 AAA batteries and fired up ZTerm on my MBP.  I was able to begin interacting with the module straight away over the UART.  I then initiated a Bluetooth connection with it and was able to create a serial connection over the Bluetooth.  This took about 5 minutes.  So far, I’m very impressed with the module.</p>

<p>With the Bluetooth module working as it should, I set my attention on the //e.  Since I intend to recreate the SSC in my card, I figured it was best to begin with a real SSC and simply connect my RS232 adapter board to the SSC directly.  This proved more tricky than setting up the Bluetooth module, as it took me a while to get the settings for <a href="http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/">ADTPro</a> just right.  I ended up getting ADTPro working using the serial port so I am now able to send disk images over from my MBP.  Tomorrow I should be able to get MODEM.MGR up and running on it and we should have the Bluetooth module up and running with it!</p>

<p>After that, I’ll need to figure out how to implement the SSC logic in my CPLD and continue laying out my board.  I did also receive my Altera CPLD dev kit.  I’m still waiting on a few parts, but in the meantime, here are a few pics:</p>

      <p>
        

        

	<p>Ok, I know I haven’t posted very regular updates, but there is a good reason for that…  I’ve been out of town for the past 3 weeks or so and I won’t return until this weekend.  So I’ve basically had to make all of this time strictly my “planning” stage.  Of course, for this project, the long planning phase has been beneficial as I’m working with some things that I am very new to – programmable logic devices, the Apple II, and these specific parts.  So while I’m definitely anxious to get hands-on with the circuit, I’ve certainly made the most of my planning time.  I’ve had to make the most of it, as the testing/implementation stages of my project are going to be crammed into the last two weeks of the challenge.  I can only hope things go relatively smoothly at that point.</p>

<p>I am happy to report that I’ve now ordered all of the parts that I will need to begin prototyping my circuit as soon as I return home.  I’ll post pics of all the parts when I get them unpacked.  I ended up settling on the <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8952">WT-32 BlueGiga module from SparkFun</a>.  This module has some great features that set it apart from the BlueSMIRF modules.   I hope to have to explore some of these additional features an sneak them into my entry as “bonus” features.  I definitely think there are more applications for this module than simply interfacing with my Treo.  ;)</p>

<p>Also, I’ve got a rudimentary board layout put together.  This is mostly to determine how much board space I’ll need.  It’s going to be tight, but it looks like I’ve got the space.  I’ll wait until I actually prototype the circuit further before fleshing out the layout much more.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for staying tuned.  I’ll post more as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>
        

        

	<p>Ok, well, I happen to be rather busy with work lately, so I haven’t been able to post since my first post, but I wanted to post this brief update.  I have been making good progress…  I have been reading lots of documentation and I’ve nearly completed my parts list.  For flexibility, I’ll be using a CPLD to implement the discrete logic/ROM required for my board design.  I’ve ordered an Altera MAX7000 series part, but am also considering using one of the comparable Atmel parts.  For compatibility, I’ll also be using the <a href="http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?jameco_page=42&amp;langId=-&amp;productId=43318&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;freeText=6551&amp;storeId=10001&amp;search_type=jamecoall&amp;ddkey=http:StoreCatalogDrillDownView">6551</a> UART chip used in the original Super Serial Card design.</p>

<p>Now, for the most significant part…  I think I’ve decided on using the <a href="http://www.bluegiga.com/WT12_Class_2_Bluetooth_Module">BlueGiga WT12 embedded Bluetooth module</a>.  There are a number of good modules out there for embedded bluetooth, but this one has a flexible firmware and supports more profiles than other modules, giving me some interesting potential beyond simply establishing the virtual serial connection with my Treo. ;)</p>

<p>Also, I’ve got a handy Eagle CAD library for the Apple II card edge connector.  (Thanks Anthony!)  With that, I should be able to start putting a schematic and board layout together soon.</p>

	<p>I’ve submitted an entry to <a href="http://retrochallenge.net/2009/">RetroChallenge 2009</a>.  I came across the challenge last year, but didn’t have the time to put together an entry.  I’m not certain I’ll be able to complete my entry this year, but I had to give it a shot.  Here’s a description:</p>

<p>I was inspired while playing around with <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~gp/VirtualII/">Virtual ][</a>.  I discovered that I could actually use my Treo 650 as a dialup modem from within Virtual ][ by using the Bluetooth serial connection from my MacBook Pro to the phone.  Having recently acquired an Apple //e, I decided to set this up on the real hardware, with a goal to designing an expansion card that would emulate the functionality of the <a href="http://www.apple2info.net/hardware/a2ssc/a2ssc.htm">Super Serial Card</a> while including the Bluetooth functionality, as well.</p>

<p>While I’ve got a number of ideas of where I want to take this eventually, for the purposes of the competition, I’m going to try to start modestly by simply getting the hardware to communicate.  I doubt that I will have full card prototyped and fab’d by the end of the competition, so I will attempt simply to complete a design (schematic / board layout).</p>

<p>I have begun evaluating and sourcing parts for the project.  I’ve also begun reading through the relevant docs.  Also, much thanks to the kind folks of #a2c.chat for their help in pulling the idea together.  I’ll be posting more updates soon.</p>
