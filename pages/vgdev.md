One of my fond interests is video game / console development.
I've always thought it was cool how video games were written to
run on special hardware specifically designed for gaming.
In the past few years I've dabbled a bit with Nintendo Gameboy
programming.  I have put up this page to highlight a few of the
consoles that I find particularly interesting.  I also hope to have
some of my own demos / programs / games / code posted in the future.  

Nintendo Gameboy - GBSimpleTerm
-------------------------------

I have just completed v0.3.3 of GBSimpleTerm, my RS232 terminal 
software for Gameboy Color based on [Ken Kaarvik's](http://www.geocities.com/kkaarvik/gameboy.html)
RS232 send and receive. You can view and download 
the source and rom:  

[GBSimpleTerm-0.3.3.tar.gz](/files/GBSimpleTerm-0.3.3.tar.gz).

GBSimpleTerm is coming along nicely.  This version (0.3.3) is primarily
just a demonstration of the user interface.  None of the communications
layer has yet been implemented.  I will release newer versions on this
page as I complete more of the program.  Here is a current screenshot
of GBSimpleTerm running on GnuBoy on Mac OS X:

**In order to run the above rom, I recommend downloading GnuBoy or
another good Gameboy Color emulator from Zophar's Domain:**

 * [Windows Emulators](http://www.zophar.net/gb.html)
 * [Unix/Linux Emulators](http://www.zophar.net/unix/gb.html)

The older incarnation of GBSimpleTerm, CommBoy, is available on my
[Gameboy Ethernet](/projects/gameboy/).  This page
explains how I've used this code to make my Gameboy Ethernet
accessible. (more or less)

The amateur Gameboy developers community is very
active and it is easy to get started programming for the Gameboy
Color or now the Gameboy Advance.

Below are just a few links to various amateur Gameboy 
development sites. The first link to devrs.com is the most comprehensive 
GBDev site yet.

Gameboy Advance
---------------

My younger brother Justin has just finished his project for History
class.  He has written a short history trivia game for the Gameboy
Advance.  He has been very generous and listed my name in the credits,
though I merely gave minor technical assistance as needed.  You can
download a copy of the rom image from http://www.justinsharp.net.

Atari Jaguar
------------
			
Another one of my favorite video game consoles is the Atari Jaguar.
The Atari Jaguar was the first 64-bit video game system ever released. 
(although that is up for debate.) The Jaguar did have impressive 
features for its time and although it is no longer commercially 
available, the Jaguar still has an active development community. 
The http://www.jagulator.com is the only 
emulator currently available, though it is still in very early alpha 
stages. Check out the following links for more info.

Atari Lynx
----------

The Atari Lynx is a handheld video game console released back in 
1989. The system was very impressive with a color screen, great sound 
and up-to 8 player gaming. Although the system is not available on 
the market anymore and games are not manufactured for it, the Lynx 
still has a community of amateur developers. Check following 
links for more details.
