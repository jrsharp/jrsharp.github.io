One of my many interests is in Sun hardware / software.  I own two
old SparcStation 2's which I used to host this website for about 6
months and achieved a 100-day uptime.  It is a great
machine for being 12 years old.  I plan to put what information I
can share about my experience with Sun stuff on this page when I can.
I had some experience with 4 Sun 280R servers at SAU.
3 were dual-processor machines.  All of them were running 750Mhz or
800Mhz UltraSparc III processors with 8MB cache each.  
They were sweet!

I also ran this website from a SparcStation 5 until it finally gave up
the ghost.  I have retired my SS2
for now and plan to keep it stored as my first full-time webserver!  I
was very pleased with my SS5 and it certainly did a better job of
handling the load than my SS2.
