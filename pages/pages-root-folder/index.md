Welcome to my home online, in which I share a little of my interests, experience, 
faith and philosophy.  Much of the content centers on technology, and my life-long 
pursuit of mastery in all manner of software and hardware engineering, design, 
architecture, etc.  As an outdoors enthusiast, I also try to share some of my hiking, 
backpacking, camping and canoeing exploits with the family, as well.

This current iteration of jonsharp.net brings with it a host of legacy content.  
The older blog entries and project pages sometimes reflect interests and projects long 
since abandoned, but some of this content was once very popular and useful to a 
number of people, and I hope that it may be still.  I intend to provide frequent 
updates to the blog and project content moving forward, as well as filling in the 
large gap left by my entrepreneurial ventures of the past nine years or so. 

The technology content itself will feature topics such as digital design, embedded 
systems development, microcontrollers, wearable computing, robotics, programmable 
logic (FPGAs), Java, Linux, open source, technology leadership, enterprise architecture 
and retrocomputing, to name a few.

Outside of technology, I may occasionally share a bit about some of the communities of
which I am a member, including Nashville's Down syndrome community, represented by the
[Down Syndrome Association of Middle Tennessee](http://somethingextra.org) and that of
my local church, [Madison Campus Seventh-day Adventist](http://madisoncampus.org).

If I've handed you one of my cards and you've come here to learn more about what I'm
about, thank you.  Drop me a line using the contact info here and keep in touch.

Enjoy!
