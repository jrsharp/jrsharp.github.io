Welcome to my home online, in which I share a little of my interests, experience,faith and philosophy.  Much of the content centers on technology, and my life-long pursuit of understanding and excellence in all manner of software and hardware engineering, design, architecture, administration, etc.  As an outdoors enthusiast, I also try to share some of my hiking, backpacking, camping and canoeing exploits, as well.  As a family man blessed with a wife that shares these values, we continue to instill these interests and values in our children.

This current iteration of jonsharp.net brings with it a host of legacy content.  The older blog entries and project pages sometime reflect interests and projects long since abandoned, but some of this content was once very popular and useful to a number of folks, so perhaps it may be still.  As I pen this, I make clear my intentions to provide frequent updates to the blog and project content moving forward, as well as filling in the large gap left by my entrepreneurial ventures of the past nine years or so. 

The technology content itself will feature topics such as digital design, embedded systems development, microcontrollers, wearable computing, robotics, programmable logic (FPGAs), Java, Linux, open source, technology leadership, enterprise architecture and retrocomputing, to name a few.

Outside of technology, I may occasionally share a bit about some of the communities of which I am a member, including Nashville's Down syndrome community, represented by the [Down Syndrome Association of Middle Tennessee](http://somethingextra.org) and that of my local church, [Madison Campus Seventh-day Adventist Church](http://madisoncampus.org).

If I've handed you one of my cards and you've come here to learn more about what I'm about, thank you.  Drop me a line using the contact info here and keep in touch.

Enjoy!
