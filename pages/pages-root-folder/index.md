Welcome to my home online, home to things that may occasionally be interesting to a select few. Mostly
there's the blog, intended to chronicle the various projects I pick up, most likely focusing on
electronics, retrocomputing, embedded systems, and other related professional technology pursuits.  I
might also share updates on other interests -- faith, family and the outdoors, to name a few.

I also maintain here a series of dedicated project pages, some of which merely provide some interesting
historical value.  Enjoy the stay, and connect with me using the links below.
